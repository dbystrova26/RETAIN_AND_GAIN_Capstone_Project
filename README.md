# RETAIN_AND_GAIN_Capstrone_Project
Using the 2019 Kaggle “Marketing Insights for E-commerce” data, enriched with Calendarific holidays, we estimate CLV with BG-NBD, Pareto/NBD, MBG-NBD, and a Gamma-Gamma spend model on RFM. Seasonality (month + holidays) is built into the CLV pipelines and the promo incrementality read to steer ROAS-positive budget decisions.
